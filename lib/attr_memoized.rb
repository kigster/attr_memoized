require 'attr_memoized/version'

# This module, when included, decorates the receiver with several useful
# methods:
#
# * Both class and instance methods #mutex are added, that can be used
#   to guard any shared resources. Each class gets their own class mutex,
#   and each instance gets it's own separate mutex.
#
# * new class method #attr_memoized is added, the syntax is as follows:
#
#        attr_memoized :attribute_name, ..., -> { block returning a value }
#
# * the block in the definition above is called via #instance_exec on the
#   object (instance of a class) and therefore has access to all private
#   methods. If the value is a symbol, it is expected to be a method.
#
# * multiple attribute names are allowed in the #attr_memoized, but they
#   will all be assigned the result of the block (last argument) when called.
#   Therefore, typically you would use #attr_memoized with one attribute at
#   a time, unless you want to have several version of the same variable:
#
# Example
# =======
#
#      class RandomNumbers
#         include AttrMemoized
#
#         attr_memoized :random, -> { rand(10) },            writer: false
#         attr_memoized :seed,   -> { Time.now.to_i % 57 }
#
#         attr_memoized :number1, :number2, -> { self.class.incr! && rand(10) }
#
#         @calls = 0
#         class << self
#           attr_reader :calls
#           def incr!; @calls = 0 unless defined(@calls); @calls += 1 ; end
#         end
#       end
#
#       @rn = RandomNumbers.new
#
#       # first call executes the block, and caches it
#       @rn.number1                          # => 3
#       # and it's saved now, and the block is no longer called
#       @rn.number1                          # => 3
#       @rn.number2                          # => 9
#       @rn.number2                          # => 9
#       # only 2 times did we ever call incr! method
#       @rn.class.calls                      # => 2
#
#       # Now #seed is also lazy-loaded, and also cached
#       @rn.seed                             # => 34
#       # And, we can change it thread safely!
#       @rn.seed = 64; @rn.seed              # => 64
#
#       # Not so with :random, which was defined without the writer:
#       @rn.random                           # => 8
#       @rn.random = 34
#       # => NoMethodError: undefined method `random=' for #<RandomNumbers:0x007ffb28105178>
